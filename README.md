├── CSS/               # Stylesheets, CSS exercises  
├── JS/                # JavaScript scripts / modules

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js & npm (for React parts)  
- A modern web browser  

### Setup & Run (React portion)

1. Navigate to the React folder (if present):  
   ```bash
   cd React
   ```

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:  
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or as shown in console).

### Using Static Parts

For HTML / CSS / JS folders, you can simply open `.html` files in your browser and view them. Use a live server extension or local HTTP server for better experience (e.g. `live-server` or VSCode Live Preview).
